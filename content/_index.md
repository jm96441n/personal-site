I'm a software developer based out of NYC. I focus on building performant and
scalable distributed systems. Things I like (in no particular order):

* [The Unix Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy), in that each program should only do one thing and do it well and that larger functionality should be composed out of these small tools.
* Hiking and traveling (though I haven't done much of either in the past year)
* [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)
* Cooking (a lot of my time not spent on the computer is spent in the kitchen)
* The pursuit to brew the perfect cup of coffee
* Loki - my dog. He's a jindo-corgi mix who's a rescue from South Korea courtesy of the kind and caring folks at [Korean K9 Rescue](https://www.koreank9rescue.org/)
