So I figured for the first post I should lay out some outline of what I'm planning on doing here! Odds are
most of my posts are going to be about software development, though there will probably be the odd one here and there
about what food I'm cooking and maybe a few on book reviews. Really, it's going to be whatever strikes my fancy
and I feel like writing about!
